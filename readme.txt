# Products of Place

In collaboration between Space10, oio has developed a interactive web app, that lets one explore AI location based designs of plates, to explore more sustainable products, using unexpected material abundance in different locations across the world.

## Usage

The Products of Place web-app was developed in the free node based react platform [Noodl](https://www.noodl.net/). Due to Noodl compiling from a node based interface to code, it is required to open the **/noodl-project** folder, upload the project to noodl and re-compile the code, incase any changes have to be done. The app is fairly simple and with some experience in node based interfaces should be straight forward.

There are two folders in this repo.

**/noodl-project** that contains the source files for the noodl project incase of changes.

**/public** folder contains the compiled code to be hosted online.
